# Build settings for OpenPegasus use in a container.

# This is the default set of environment variables for building OpenPegasus

# TODO: OpenPegasus was not consistent in the use of true/false vs exists/not-exist
# for the resolution of what are really binary configuration variables. In some
# cases only set/not-set really work and in others true/false/not-set apply. We
# need to get these all clearly defined in this file and the doc files.

# See pegasus/doc/BuildAndReleaseOptiions.html for more detailed information
# on the options

# The required env variables to define the location of the pegasus project
# in the container PEGASUS_ROOT and PEGASUS_HOME must be already defined.
# They are defined in the file `Dockerfile` as environment variables.

# Set the platform to the linux platform we use in the container. The
# Docker image is based on a Linux x86_64 OpenPegasus platform definition
# This environment variable is defined in the Dockerfile so it is not used
# in the env variables.
# PEGASUS_PLATFORM=LINUX_X86_64_GNU

# OpenPegasus build configuration is completely defined by multiple
# environment variables.  The OpenPegasus doc directory defines all of these
# environment variables. The setting for a simple OpenPegasus test container
# are defined below.
#

PEGASUS_USE_DEFAULT_MESSAGES=true

# The container will service both HTTP and HTTPS.
# Define the connection and pegasus security environment including
# ssl, pam, and pegasus usergroup


# If set, a version of OpenPegasus that supports SSL (i.e., https) is built.
# If the PEGASUS_HAS_SSL variable is set, the variable OPENSSL_HOME must
# also be defined. The OPENSSL_HOME variable is used, by the OpenPegasus build,
# to determine the location of the OpenSSL include files, libraries and binaries.
# TODO: verify OpenSSL_HOME usage
PEGASUS_HAS_SSL=true

#  Specifies the location of the OpenSSL SDK directory. This directory must
#contain the OpenSSL include directory, $(OPENSSL_HOME)/include, and the OpenSSL
#library directory, $(OPENSSL_HOME)/lib.  Default = TODO
# OPENSSL_HOME=/usr

# Enables support for PAM-(Pluggable Authentication Modules) based authentication.
# Default is false
PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION=true

# Enables support for PAM-(Pluggable Authentication Modules) based
# authentication and authorization. When choosing this PAM method the PAM session
# started through pam_start is kept open for the complete CIM request. The PAM
# item PAM_RHOST will be set to the connection IP address. This allows PAM
# modules to restrict number of concurrent connections from a single host. If
# PEGASUS_PAM_SESSION_SECURITY is set, you cannot enable the Privilege Separation
# feature (PEGASUS_ENABLE_PRIVILEGE_SEPARATION) or the authentication-only PAM
# mechanism (PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION).
# PEGASUS_PAM_SESSION_SECURITY=true

# Moves the processing of PAM requests from the CIM Server process to a
# separate process managed by the CIM Server.
# If PAM Authentication is enabled, the PAM API is used, during the processing
# of each request, to authenticate the client. This level of use makes the CIM
# Server extremely sensitive to memory leaks in the PAM library. In addition,
# certain PAM modules are not thread-safe. If your platform is experiencing
# problems with PAM Authentication, use of this option may provide a work-around.
# PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC requires PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION to be set.
# PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC=false


# If set to true enables the HTTP Negotiate authentication method, as described
# by RFC 4559, both to Pegasus server and client. Enabling this option also adds
# 1) a new option to the runtime configuration variable "httpAuthType" and 2) a
# new runtime variable "mapToLocalName".
# PEGASUS_NEGOTIATE_AUTHENTICATION=true

#
#  OpenPegasus release status
#

# If set, OpenPegasus is built using the "Release Build" configuration options.
# By default, OpenPegasus is built using the "Development Build" configuration
# options.  See pegasus docs for more information
# PEGASUS_USE_RELEASE_CONFIG_OPTIONS=true


#
#  Security restrictions support
#
# Builds a version of OpenPegasus that allows an administrator to restrict access
# to CIM operations to members of a designated set of groups.  Refer to the
# authorizedUserGroupsconfiguration option for additional details. Default if
# not set is not set
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_USERGROUP_AUTHORIZATION=true

# When set (to anything) during the build, OpenPegasus compiles with
# localization support. The ICU (International Components for Unicode)
# variables, ICU_ROOT and ICU_INSTALL, indicate that the localization
# support is based on ICU. Only ICU is supported at this time.
# If the PEGASUS_HAS_MESSAGES is not set, OpenPegasus is built without
# localization support. This means that all messages sent by the CIM
# Server and the CLIs are in English.
# Requires localization support TODO
# PEGASUS_HAS_MESSAGES=true

#
# Query and query language support
#

# When this variable is set to true, support the DMTF Indications Profile
# (DSP1054) is included in OpenPegasus.  If this variable is not set or set to
# false, support for the DMTF Indications Profile will not be included.

# When this variable is set to false, support for Indication Subscription filters
# that have CQL as the language is disabled. It does not remove CQL from the build.
PEGASUS_ENABLE_CQL=true

# When this environment variable is set, an E-Mail Indication Handler is built as
# part of the OpenPegasus build.  The E-Mail Indication Handler can be used to
# delivered CIM Indications to a designated e-mail address.
PEGASUS_ENABLE_EMAIL_HANDLER=false

#
# Repository storage mode support
#

# Storage mode of the CIM repository created on initial build
# This variable defines the default mode used to create repositories that
# are constructed as part of the automated build tests.  It does not affect the
# runtime environment. Valid values include: XML (causes the repository to be
# built in XML mode); BIN (causes the repository to be built in binary mode).
# Use cimconfig to modify the runtime environment.
# We use BIN because it is significantly smaller than XML and faster
# Set to BIN because it results in smallest/fastest repository
PEGASUS_REPOSITORY_MODE=BIN

# If true, new repository stores are created using a SQLite database. Existing
# file-based stores will continue to be recognized and operate seamlessly.
# If PEGASUS_USE_SQLITE_REPOSITORY is set to true and SQLite files are not
# installed in default search locations, SQLITE_HOME must also be configured.
# PEGASUS_REPOSITORY_STORE_COMPLETE_CLASSES may not be set to true when
# PEGASUS_USE_SQLITE_REPOSITORY is set to true.
# PEGASUS_USE_SQLITE_REPOSITORY=true

# This variable defines the default contents of a class definition in the
# repository store when a new repository is created. Specifically, when set to
# true, propagated elements are included in a class definition in the persistent
# store. The contents of a class definition returned from the repository
# interface is not affected by this option. Default value is false
# A repository which stores complete class definitions does not allow
# modifications to non-leaf classes or changes to a superclass designation.
# Complete classes use more storage space, often twice as much as local
# (incomplete) classes. Class retrieval may be more expensive when local classes
# are stored. No specific mechanism is available to change this setting in an
# existing repository.
# PEGASUS_REPOSITORY_STORE_COMPLETE_CLASSES=false

# If set the Repository Compression logic is built and enabled and compressed
# and non compressed repositories are supported. If not set then compressed
# repositories are not supported.
# NOTE: Setting this variable  requires extra library and header file for zlib.
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_COMPRESSED_REPOSITORY=true


#
#  Statistics support
#

# If true, the CIM Server will be built to count the number of CIM indications
# generated by providers and matched with subscriptions. If false or not set,
# indication statistic support will not be included. Default Value: true
PEGASUS_ENABLE_INDICATION_COUNT=true

#
#  Support for OOP - Out-of-process providers
#  The default for linux is True.
#  However, for the normal container mode we will run the
#  providers in process since it is faster
#  If additional providers are installed enabling OOP will facilitate testing
#
PEGASUS_DEFAULT_ENABLE_OOP=false

# If true, OpenPegasus uses a faster binary protocol between local clients and
# the CIM server. If false, OpenPegasus uses the conventional XML-based protocol
# instead. See PEP#340 for more details.
PEGASUS_ENABLE_PROTOCOL_BINARY



# Control of EMAIL handler

# Default value: Not set
PEGASUS_ENABLE_DMTF_INDICATION_PROFILE_SUPPORT=true

#
#  Server logging support
#

# When this environment variable is set, a SysLog Indication Handler is built
# as part of the OpenPegasus build.  The SysLog Indication Handler can be used
# to delivered CIM Indications to the system log file.
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_SYSTEM_LOG_HANDLER=true

# If set, OpenPegasus will be built to send log messages to the system logger
# (syslog). Otherwise, log messages will be sent to OpenPegasus specific log files.
PEGASUS_USE_SYSLOGS=true

# Description: When this variable is set to false, support for audit logging
# will NOT be built into OpenPegasus. If this variable is set to true, or not
# set, support for audit logging will be included in the build. All other
# values are invalid.
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGER=false

#
#  Optional functionality support
#

# Enable the provider manager for providers that use the CMPI interface
# from providers to the OpenPegasus server
# If set to true, the CMPI_Provider manager is created and cmpi providers
# included in the test environment. Default is true
PEGASUS_ENABLE_CMPI_PROVIDER_MANAGER=true

# Enable the WSMAN protocol and the server components for that protocol.  The
# default is false since protocol never became part of projects like SNIA
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_PROTOCOL_WSMAN=true

# TODO
#PEGASUS_MAX_THREADS_PER_SVC_QUEUE

#
#   SNMP support - See Pegasus docs

# Interop provider support

# If true, the OpenPegasus Interop Provider will be build. If false or not set,
# the OpenPegasus Interop Provider will not be built.
# A number of features controlled by OpenPegasus build options are dependent on
# the Interop Provider.  Please refer to PEGASUS_ENABLE_SLP,
# PEGASUS_DISABLE_PERFINST, and PEGASUS_ENABLE_DMTF_INDICATION_PROFILE_SUPPORT
# for additional details.
# TODO: What is the default
PEGASUS_ENABLE_INTEROP_PROVIDER=true

# This variable is used for configuring the Interop namespace name. This option
# helps to establish a consistent Interop Namespace as mentioned in DMTF
# specification.(DSP1033)
# If set it defines the name for the interop namespace. The allowed
# values are root/PG_InterOp, root/interop or interop.  The default interop
# namespace if this not set is root/PG_InterOp.
# Note: Only limited pegasus internal tests can be run if
# the interop namespace is not set to root/PG_InterOp since some test verification
# depends on the specific string root/PG_InterOp. To avoid that issue for now
# the namespace is set to root/PG_InterOp in Docker_wbemserver-build for the
# test target and that whole repository used only for the tests.  The repository
# below is used to provision the server when the server run image is built.
PEGASUS_INTEROP_NAMESPACE=root/PG_InterOp

# Builds a version of OpenPegasus that disables support for gathering performance data.
# Considerations: The CIM_ObjectManager.GatherStatisticalData property is used to
# control statistic gathering.  Once enabled, statistical data can be viewed by
# retrieving instances of the CIM_StatisticalData class. Support for gathering #
# performance data requires PEGASUS_ENABLE_INTEROP_PROVIDER to be enabled.
# If PEGASUS_ENABLE_INTEROP_PROVIDER is explicitly disabled (i.e., set to false),
# then PEGASUS_DISABLE_PERFINST must be set to true.  If PEGASUS_DISABLE_PERFINST
# is not defined or set to false and PEGASUS_ENABLE_INTEROP_PROVIDER is not set,
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_INTEROP_PROVIDER will be automatically enabled.
# values: not-set/set. Default: not-set (peformance info gathered)
#PEGASUS_DISABLE_PERFINST=false

#
# Network options
#

# This variable can be used to specify whether IPv6 support should be included
# in OpenPegasus. When this variable is set to 'false', support for IPv6 socket
# APIs and structures is disabled.
# NOTE: The default curently in Docker is to disable IPV6.
# values: not-set/false/true. Default: true
PEGASUS_ENABLE_IPV6=false

#  If true, a version of OpenPegasus that supports JMPI providers and their
# dependent components is built. If false or not set, support for JMPI
# Providers is not included in OpenPegasus.  All other values are invalid.
# Requires java environment installed.
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_JMPI_PROVIDER_MANAGER

# If set, builds in support so that objects returned from provider instance
# operations can be validated. The enableNormalization must also be set to 'true' (default),
# If PEGASUS_ENABLE_OBJECT_NORMALIZATION is set, two new configuration options
# are defined: enableNormalization and excludeModulesFromNormalization.
# values: not-set/false/true
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_OBJECT_NORMALIZATION=false

# This variable is used to enable a set of workarounds that support the use of
# OpenPegasus in the SNIA Test Environment.
# Defined a specific change to WQL parser for SNIA testing. This allows
# dotted property names. Default is to not set this.
# This is considered experimental and for WQL only.
# PEGASUS_SNIA_EXTENSIONS=true

# Enable pegasus to act as webserver capable of serving webpages. When
# authentication is disabled, Anybody can modify the pegasus cimserver.
# Please enable authentication when using webadmin to prevent unauthorized
# access.
# The web pages provide information on the runninb pegasus configuration and
# are available from the same ports as defined for http and https requests to
# the pegasus server.
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_PROTOCOL_WEB

# If set to 'true', the OpenPegasus CIM server will use HTTP cookies for
# session management (RFC 6265).
# After a successful client authentication the client is given a cookie. The
# client is then not asked for re-authentication as long as it provides the same
# cookie in all subsequent requests and until the session expires. Session expiry
# is configurable using httpSessionTimeout configuration option.
# Nothing changes for clients that do not support HTTP cookies (RFC 6465) -
# their requests are authenticated as usual, either using Basic or Negotiate
# authentication mechanisms.
# Purpose of this option is to speed up request processing - both Basic and
# Negotiate authentication can take some time, which will form large fraction of
# system load on busy servers. Default Value: true (on supported platforms, see
# below)
# This option can be set to true only when the underlying platform providers
# cryptographically strong random numbers (to generate strong session ID).
# Currently these platforms are zOS (using native API) and any platform with
# OpenSSL. In other words, PEGASUS_ENABLE_SESSION_COOKIES can be enabled only
# when PEGASUS_HAS_SSL is set or on zOS.
# values are not-set/false/true.
# Note that while this option is enabled by default (i.e. the code is
# compiled), it is still turned off in default runtime configuration. System
# administrators must explicitly set httpSessionTimeout configuration option to
# nozero value to enable this feature.
PEGASUS_ENABLE_SESSION_COOKIES=true

#
#  SLP Support
#  NOTE: SLP is not enabled because we have not found a reliable
#  version of OpenSLP source code recently so SLP is not enabled.
#

# OpenSLP, http://openslp.org, is an open-source implementation of Service
# Location Protocol. If the PEGASUS_USE_OPENSLP variable is defined, OpenPegasus
# will be built to use the OpenSLP implementation of SLP instead of the internal
# OpenPegasus implementation of SLP. The OpenSLP libaries are NOT included as
# part of OpenPegasus. Default Value: Not Set.
# PEGASUS_ENABLE_SLP must be defined if this variable is set.
# values are not-set/false/true.
# PEGASUS_USE_OPENSLP

# This variable controls of the inclusion of SLP functionality in the
# OpenPegasus build. When this environment variable is set to 'true', SLP
# functionality will be included as part of the OpenPegasus build.  If this
# variable is set to 'false' or not set, the SLP functionality will not be
# included.  All other values are considered invalid and will result in a
# build error (e.g., "PEGASUS_ENABLE_SLP ($(PEGASUS_ENABLE_SLP)) invalid,
# must be true or false").
# Requires that system include OpenSLP functionality.
# See pegasus doc before enabling this option
# values are not-set/false/true. Default is no SLP when not-set/false
PEGASUS_ENABLE_SLP=false

# Specifies the location of the OpenSLP SDK directory. This directory must
# contain the OpenSLP include directory, $(PEGASUS_OPENSLP_HOME)/include,
# and the OpenSLP library directory, $(PEGASUS_OPENSLP_HOME)/lib.
# PEGASUS_OPENSLP_HOME

# Most SLP implementations allow a lifetime value to be specified in the
# registration sent to the SLP SA or DA. The PEGASUS_SLP_REG_TIMEOUT build
# variable allows a lifetime (ie. timeout) value to be specified on the SLP
# registration, with a 're-registration' being sent to SLP at the same specified
# timeout interval. The purpose of this lifetime or timeout value is to avoid the
# accumulation of stale service information in the SA or DA.
# Value is in seconds.
# PEGASUS_SLP_REG_TIMEOUT= 300

#
#  Debug and trace control variables
#  Debug options defined below to minimize OpenPegasus build size.
#

# Debug build options
# Enable the compiler debug mode which provides additional internal tests
# of the server and some displays. Default is not-set.  Any string enables
# debug mode. Debug is set false for the container because it significantly
# reduces the OpenPegasus object file size.
# PEGASUS_DEBUG=true

# If true, the CIM Server is compiled without method enter and exit trace
# statements.  Trace Level 5 will continue to be accepted as a valid trace level
# but, without the method enter and exit trace statements, it will be equivalent
# to Trace Level 4. If PEGASUS_REMOVE_METHODTRACE is false or not set, method
# enter and exit trace statements are included.  All other values are considered
# invalid and will result in a build error.
PEGASUS_REMOVE_METHODTRACE=true

# The following variable set to true reduces size by not including some
# information in the trace output.  TODO: This may not be documented in
# the options document. Default is false
# PEGASUS_NO_FILE_LINE_TRACE=true

# Enable the trace facility in the pegasus client code. Default is false
# default value is not set.
PEGASUS_CLIENT_TRACE_ENABLE=true

# Causes compiler to remove all PEGASUS_ASSERT statements. default is false
# default value is not set.
# PEGASUS_NOASSERTS=false

# The following variable set to true reduces size by not including some
# information in the trace output.  TODO: This may not be documented in
# the options document. Default when notset is no trace from client. Any
# string enables this option
# PEGASUS_NO_FILE_LINE_TRACE=true

#
#  Configurations of OpenPegasus tests
#

# Define repository version.  This is used at least for development builds
# and installs the DMTF schema defined and available in the directory
# pegasus/schemas into the namespaces. NOTE: schemas must be installed
# in that directory with the instructions in that directory to be compilable
# through the pegasus make repository command.
# If not defined, the default is DMTF  schema  version 2.41
#
# PEGASUS_CIM_SCHEMA=CIM241

# If set to true, this variable can be used to reduce the time required to
# build OpenPegasus by significantly reducing the number of tests that are built.
# Setting this variable to true affects the behavior of all recursive make targets
# (e.g., clean, depend, all, unittests, alltests, and slptests). Use of this
# variable with test-related targets (e.g., unittests, alltests and slptests)
# can produce unexpected results. To avoid creating an inconsistent PEGASUS_HOME
# directory, the PEGASUS_HOME directory (i.e., the OpenPegasus build directory)
# should be removed prior to enabling or disabling this variable.
# Values: not-set/true/false where not-set = false
PEGASUS_SKIP_MOST_TEST_DIRS=false

# Default definition of tests to run.  This env variable is only for this Docker
# and is not part of OpenPegasus configuration variables. It defines the test
# target in pegasus TestMakefile to call including;
#     unittests, servertests alltests sanitytests.
# If a simpler subset of tests is to be used, that name
# can replace alltests (ex. unittests, servertests). See pegasus Makefile and
# TestMakefile for more information on pegasus test targets
# When not set, no tests are run. However, the test repository is always set up.
# This is useful because the complete suite of tests for OpenPegasus can take
# multiple hours to run.
# All of the defined test targets require that the OpenPegasus test repository
# be instaled.  The setup of this test repository is included in the
PEGASUS_TEST_TARGET="alltests"
