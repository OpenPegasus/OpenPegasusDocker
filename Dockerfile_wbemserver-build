# Pegasus directories.  The OpenPegasus run directory is the single directory
# that will contain the lib and bin directories of the OpenPegasus run-time
# in the run image

# Define the OpenPegasus run settings. These are minimal.
#
# Settings below that are flags, with values set to true, enable the action
# simply through the existence of the variable.  The variables value has no
# effect.  Note that there are almost NO environment variables to control
# pegasus execution.  Execution variations are controlled through the
# config variables that can be viewed through the client cimconfig utility and
# a terminal or the OpenPegasus web admin interface which is on the same
# uri/ports and the running OpenPegasus

# Add OpenPegasus bin directory to PATH to get access to runtime components
