# Default is false
#ENV PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION=true

# Builds a version of OpenPegasus that allows an administrator to restrict access
# to CIM operations to members of a designated set of groups.  Refer to the
# authorizedUserGroupsconfiguration option for additional details. Default if

# enabled. When not set, ExecQuery operation requests get a NotSupported response.
#ENV PEGASUS_ENABLE_EXECQUERY=true

# When this variable is set to false, support for Indication Subscription filters
# that have CQL as the language is disabled. It does not remove CQL from the build.

# Enable the provider manager for providers that use the CMPI interface

# (syslog). Otherwise, log messages will be sent to OpenPegasus specific log files.
#ENV PEGASUS_USE_SYSLOGS=true

# This variable is used for configuring the Interop namespace name. This option
# helps to establish a consistent Interop Namespace as mentioned in DMTF
# specification.(DSP1033)
# If set it defines the name for the interop namespace. The allowed
# values are root/PG_Interop, root/interop or interop.  The default interop namespace if
# this not set is root/PG_Interop.
# Note: Only limited pegasus internal tests can be run if
# the interop namespace is not set to root/PG_Interop since some test verification
# depends on the specific stringroot/PG_Interop

# Â This variable defines the default mode used to create repositories that
# are constructed as part of the automated build tests.  It does not affect the
# runtime environment. Valid values include: XML (causes the repository to be
# built in XML mode); BIN (causes the repository to be built in binary mode).
# Use cimconfig to modify the runtime environment.
# We use BIN because it is significantly smaller than XML and faster
#ENV PEGASUS_REPOSITORY_MODE=BIN

# If set the Repository Compression logic is built and enabled and compressed
# and non compressed repositories are supported. If not set then compressed
# repositories are not supported.
# NOTE: Setting this variable  requires an extra library and header file for zlib.

# Define repository version.  This is used at least for development builds
# and installs the DMTF schema defined and available in the directory
# pegasus/schemas into the namespaces. NOTE: schemas must be installed

#
# ENV PEGASUS_CIM_SCHEMA=CIM241

# If true, new repository stores are created using a SQLite database. Existing
# file-based stores will continue to be recognized and operate seamlessly.
# If PEGASUS_USE_SQLITE_REPOSITORY is set to true and SQLite files are not
# installed in default search locations, SQLITE_HOME must also be configured.

# PEGASUS_USE_SQLITE_REPOSITORY is set to true.
# ENV PEGASUS_USE_SQLITE_REPOSITORY=true

# If set to true, this variable can be used to reduce the time required to
# build OpenPegasus by significantly reducing the number of tests that are built.
# Setting this variable to true affects the behavior of all recursive make targets
# (e.g., clean, depend, all, unittests, alltests, and slptests). Use of this
# variable with test-related targets (e.g., unittests, alltests and slptests)
# can produce unexpected results. To avoid creating an inconsistent PEGASUS_HOME
# directory, the PEGASUS_HOME directory (i.e., the OpenPegasus build directory)
# should be removed prior to enabling or disabling this variable.

# ENV PEGASUS_SKIP_MOST_TEST_DIRS=true

# This variable is used to enable a set of workarounds that support the use of
# OpenPegasus in the SNIA Test Environment.
# Defined a specific change to WQL parser for SNIA testing. This allows
