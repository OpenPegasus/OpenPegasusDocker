OpenPegasusDocker 0.1.1 - Release
---------------------------------
branch: main

This version of OpenPegasusDocker creates a minimal version of a running
OpenPegasus Docker container that runs as part of the pywbemtools test suite.

It was build using OpenPegasus 14.2 but the lastest version of the main
rather than a release tag.

It is committed as a release tag because it is the current container version
committed to the docker repository kschopmeyer as

kschopmeyer/openpegasus-server:0.1.1
